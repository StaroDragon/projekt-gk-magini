 
A rather simple flag prop.  

It consists of a flag that was run as a cloth sim in Blender, pole and base.

The flag and pole are UV mapped and the flag template is included.  There is an oak texture included.  In Daz Studio it looks best at about 4 horizontal tiles and 1 vertical (it has a top to bottom color difference, so it doesn't quite seamlessly tile vertically).  There are three flag maps included (US, Canada and UK).  Also there are 3 dsa material files (one for each country).

Currently there is no Studio prop file nor is it in a proper Studio file structure.  It is a raw obj, at Studio scale of 90".  To use it must be imported into Studio (use the Daz Studio scale in the import dialog box) and if being used in 4.5 or later, a folder should be created in your Runtime/Textures folder to house the image maps and then, once they are there, they should manually be reloaded to the prop and then it should be saved as a prop asset.

Also, unlike most of my stuff, this is being released with no restrictions.  In other words...public domain.
